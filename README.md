# Introduction
This is the implementation part of the subject 40989-Proyectos de Ingeniería y Gestión del Software (PIGS), done by group T1.2. This is an Angular application that uses Firebase for persistance. Firebase support will eventually be down for security related reasons.
# Setup
## 1. Install Node Package Manager
Verify that Nodejs is installed with:

`node --version`

## 2. Clone the repository
Move to a convenient directory and:

`git clone https://github.com/Isac-AS/PIGS.git`

Check the folders and move to:

`cd pigs-frontend`


## 3. Install npm packages
This command will hopefully install @angular/material and @angular/fire and hopefully @angular/cli:

`npm install`

If vulnerability reports are found, fix them with:

`npm audit fix`

If @angular/cli is not installed: 

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## 4. If angular fire cries check these links
